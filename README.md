# LectVRe
Immersive lecture experience from the comfort of your bedroom...

It effectively serves as a virtual lecture theatre, allowing people to listen to a lecturer's presentation, whilst taking notes from their slides. Using rooms created by the lecturer, other participants can easily join the room using a simple code, then have access to tools to raise their hand, and make notes. Voice chat allows people to talk to other participants and the lectuerer in the the hall. There were plans to have a menu to have character customisation in the lecture, however time constraints prevented us from implementing this.

lectVRe is built using Unity, due to its support for the Google Cardboard platform. The backend server that handles the user's character customizations, positions and loading of the slides is written in Python using the Django framework.
